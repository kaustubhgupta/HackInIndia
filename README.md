# HackInIndia
It is a hackathon organized by Script Foundation. Hackathon [link](https://www.hackinindia.com/).

## Idea
We are aiming to develop a reminder application that is not your regular application but an ML-based application. In this application, not only you but your friends, family, and colleagues can set alarms, reminders, and tasks on your phone. Just put in your reminder/task in the text field and our application will sort the task according to its urgency level. For example, 
- I need to do this task today only.
- I will do this tomorrow. 

In this case, the ML model comes in the picture. Our application will pick up the words (tomorrow,meeting, reminding) and will ask for a confirmation to set a reminder for the meeting. The 1st task will be sorted on top and frequent reminders will be given on your email id and notification bar on an android device.

## Relevance
This application is required in the user’s daily life. Every day there are events, meetings, deadlines which a person tends to forget in the day’s rush. And here our application comes to rescue. It will provide frequent reminders on events and tasks a person tends to forget. Hence relevant to a person in various fields be it a student, businessman, teacher, developer, and so on.

## Cost
For this hackathon, we will be working on developing a website to accomplish this task. It is pretty much easy to implement applications. The effective cost would be the domain charges and if this application is deployed in android, Google will charge a minimal amount for publishing the app.

## Comparison to Existing Products
If we compare existing products, the reminders/task/alarm application installed in our phones works manually, we have to set alarm/reminder on our own whether it’s speaking to Google Assistant or Alexa, we have to do some work but our application will set it automatically based on your input.

## Scope of Improvement 
This is a minimalist application that is based on the input given by the user but it can be extended to various use cases. We can add further add-on sending wishes directly to reminders of birthdays/special events and other user-specific events. It can be integrated as a telegram bot in groups to track various events. It can also be integrated with WhatsApp and clipboard of android phones.

## Privacy Concern:
We understand how much important and sensitive data can be. We will make sure to provide proper authentication and authorization so that your data remains with you only.

## Technology Stack:
